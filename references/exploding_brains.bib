abstract = {Conservation of linear and angular momenta, and conservation of energy are examined for the material-point method (MPM). It is shown that MPM can be formulated with implicit energy and momentum conserving mesh dynamics for hyperelastic materials. With a consistent mass matrix the resulting overall numerical method preserves the conservative properties of the mesh solution. Energy dissipation and angular momentum errors are also quantified for a lumped mass formulation. Properties of the method are illustrated in numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Stomakhin2013a,
abstract = {Snow is a challenging natural phenomenon to visually simulate. While the graphics community has previously considered accumulation and rendering of snow, animation of snow dynamics has not been fully addressed. Additionally, existing techniques for solids and fluids have difficulty producing convincing snow results. Specifically, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and fluid-like properties is difficult to handle. Consequently, this paper presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a usercontrollable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character interactions. Copyright {\textcopyright} ACM. Copyright {\textcopyright} ACM 2013.},
